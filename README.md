# Determining  Most Effective Approach to Increase SAT Participation

-  What leads to a high SAT participation rate for a given state?
-  Will an approach to a given state be applicable to another?

## Problem Statement

### Background:
The College Board is an organization that administers one of the most widely used college entrance exams – the SAT. In recent years, however, states have been forgoing the SAT for their primary competitor – the ACT. To address their losing market share, College Board released a newly formatted SAT in March 2016. This new format is intended to more closely align with what students are currently learning and serve as a better aptitude measurement for college. 

In order to examine what changes the newly formatted SAT led to in regards to participation and to recommend ways of increasing participation, I analyzed SAT and ACT data in 2017 and 2018. The data includes participation rates, total scores, and section scores.  

### Takeaways:
States that have seen a sudden growth in participation or have reached 100% participation will be helpful in drawing these insights. Specifically, Colorado, Illinois and Idaho. As of 2018, they have a participation rate of 100%, 99% and 100%, respectively. Further investigation revealed two primary reasons for such high rates:
-  **Statewide Testing Contracts**
    -  The College Board recently secured testing contracts with both Colorado and Illinois, leading to an immediate participation increase in 2018.


-  **SAT School Day**
    -  The College Board does not currently have a contract with the state of Idaho to administer the SAT. However, SAT School Day is carried out within their school districts. This event is conducted during the weekday, on campus and free-of-charge. This only furthered inclined Idaho’s students to take the SAT, increasing participation rate from an already high 93% in 2017 to 100% in 2018. 

### Recommendations: 
**Secure statewide testing contracts**: The dramatic increase in SAT participation for Colorado and Illinois within the span of two years demonstrates the importance of establishing state partnerships. Executing a contract leads to immediate results.
 
**Implement SAT School Day**: Though securing testing contracts proves to be the most direct method in increasing participation rates, it may not the easiest nor fastest to attain. As an alternative, the College Board can choose to implement SAT School Day within more school districts. Idaho’s 100% participation rate in 2018 justifies the value of having such an event, especially for states that already have moderate to high SAT participation. Given the choice, students will prefer the convenience and accessibility provided by SAT School Day over the ACT.

**Target relevant states**: The ideal outcome is to increase SAT participation rate in all states, but it’s not practical to target all of them. To properly allocate our resources, do not target states that are still contractually bound to ACT. Rather, direct efforts towards states that already show a propensity for the SAT or at least those that do not have a strong preference for either. Presenting the SAT and its free resources will more likely incline these states to make a temporary, if not permanent, change. California is a desirable target because participation is fairly distributed between the SAT and ACT.
